You survived the week! It is now Friday night, and you don&apos;t have many things to do. Maybe I should call Jennifer and see if she&apos;s doing anything right now. If she&apos;s not, then I&apos;ll ask if she wants to have dinner with me.

    <result xml:space="preserve">This is a dish that Jennifer and I used to make when we were kids. It is still a good recipe, in fact, I made it a month ago, and it tasted great! But I accidentally ripped the paper when I made it last time. To make matters worse, I&apos;ve completely forgotten how to make it. I can only make out some writing of the scraps. &quot;Soup&quot;...&quot;oven&quot;...&quot;smokey&quot;...&quot;M and Ms&quot;. Not going to be much help, but it&apos;s all I got for now.

    <result xml:space="preserve">My Kitchen
This is where I cook my meals everyday. It is a medium sized room with standard kitchen appliances. The oven is in the far corner of the room, and the stove is to your right, and a smoke vent is above it. The refrigerator is on the right wall. There is a marble table in the middle of the room. My recipe locker is next to the refridgerator. The kitchen is lit by while fourecent lights and a window that looks out into the yard.

Clementine Way
This is the street that runs past the front of my house. Good thing the street lights are on, otherwise, it would be pitch black. The sidewalk and asphalt are in good condition. Cool Autumn breezes make you shiver slightly. The Intersection by Jennifer&apos;s house is to the east, and my house is to the south.

Where am I going? I haven&apos;t even contacted Jennifer yet.
