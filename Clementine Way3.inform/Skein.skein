You survived the week! It is now Friday night, and you don&apos;t have many things to do. Maybe I should call Jennifer and see if she&apos;s doing anything right now. If she&apos;s not, then I&apos;ll ask if she wants to have dinner with me.

This is Jennifer&apos;s Living Room. I&apos;ve only been over here once or twice. It is a fairly large room, but it has a cozy feeling to it. Jennifer&apos;s Porch is to the north.

It is a wood door painted red. It has a simple brass keyhole and brass knob. The plaque on the door presents the numbers &quot;6512&quot;

You see Jennifer passed out on the rug. At first you think that she is just sleeping, but then you notice a bottle of insulin and a bottle of glucose next to her! Maybe I should ask her about if she is ok, about the insulin bottle or the glucose bottle?

This is the street that runs past the front of my house. Good thing the street lights are on, otherwise, it would be pitch black. The sidewalk and asphalt are in good condition.

Clementine Way
This is the street that runs past the front of my house. Good thing the street lights are on, otherwise, it would be pitch black. The sidewalk and asphalt are in good condition. Cool Autumn breezes make you shiver slightly. The Intersection by Jennifer&apos;s house is to the east, and my house is to the south.

Where am I going? I haven&apos;t even contacted Jennifer yet.
