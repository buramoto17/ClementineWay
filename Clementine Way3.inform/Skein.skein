You survived the week! It is now Friday night, and you don&apos;t have many things to do. Maybe I should call Jennifer and see if she&apos;s doing anything right now. If she&apos;s not, then I&apos;ll ask if she wants to have dinner with me.

You carefully put the uncooked mixture into the heated oven. Then, you set the timer for an hour and decide to take a nap. As soon as the casserole is done, you should call Jennifer. 

 You wake up an hour later. A delicous smell floats through out the house. Time to take the casserole out.

Clementine Way
This is the street that runs past the front of my house. Good thing the street lights are on, otherwise, it would be pitch black. The sidewalk and asphalt are in good condition. Cool Autumn breezes make you shiver slightly. The Intersection by Jennifer&apos;s house is to the east, and my house is to the south.

Where am I going? I haven&apos;t even contacted Jennifer yet.
